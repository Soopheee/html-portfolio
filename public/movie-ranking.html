<h1>Soph's Top Three Movies</h1>
<h2>The 3 movies I chose as my faves</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Love Actually</h3>
<p>Easily the best movie of all time. I watch this every Christmas without fail and happily watch it throughout the year too. Incredible acting from the likes of Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, that have led to some memorable scenes filled with both joy and nostalgia for myself, my family, and my friendship group.</p>
<h3>Fox and the Hound</h3>
<p>My top animated Disney movie of all time. I need to re-watch it because it has been a while, but the feeling of heartbreak at the thought of this movie has long outlived the storyline in my memory. A truly adorable movie.</p>
<h3>Juno</h3>
<p>This one is difficult for me. I was obsessed with it as a teenager and still love it to this day, but now Elliot Page (formerly Ellen Page) has transitioned, my thoughts about this movie are complex. I imagine it must've been a very difficult role for him to play and I can't help but wonder how he feels about it now. Nevertheless, viewed in isolation, this is a cracker. The dynamic between Michael Cera and Page is incredible and I adore it.</p>
