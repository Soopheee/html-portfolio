<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Location.</h2>
<p>I grew up in Hailsham, East Sussex, but now live in Newport, South Wales, with my husband and two step-sons, aged 12 and 13. 
</p>
<h2>Marriage.</h2>
<p>I got married in October 2021 and climbed Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) on my honeymoon in July 2022!
</p>
<h2>Work and Studies.</h2>
<p>I have worked for Hastings Direct for 11 years; 6 years within Claims and the last 2 in Digital. During my time in Claims, I also completed an OU degree in Language Studies (French & German).
</p>
<h2>Hobbies.</h2>
<p>I like to go hiking in my spare time, even though I'm a self-declared couch potato. Wales has lots of amazing views to explore which makes the struggle worth it!
